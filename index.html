      <h3>Which City?</h3>

            <p id="cityp"> I would like to visit Tokyo city because the Japanese culture interests me. I also enjoy Asian cuisine and am fond of street
                markets, of which there is no shortage in Tokyo city. A notable mention are the pink sakura trees, which blanket many areas of
                the city as if marking their territory - making it clear to onlookers, that they are indeed, in Japan. </p>

        <h3>A Foreign Language</h3>

        <p> I would like to learn Japanese because it is a nice language to hear others speaking. I have always enjoyed listening to Japanese
          people speaking their language. </p>
